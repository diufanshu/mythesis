Multi-type massive production usually takes part in the assembly line of electronic parts for auto-mobile, however, a myopic way that specialize assembly line by the main factories is widely used, so that low utilization , high redundancy and unbalance production always happens. A sound solution is to despecialize the assembly line, the implementation of this solution is a so called multi-type multi-assembly-line take-turn scheduling problem. In this study, 2 mathematical models is built for different levels of managenent to apply. With proposed concept of \textit{virtual list}, 
%schedule rule and heuristic tactic, 5 algorithms: Cyc --ATC, Cyc -- ATCS, Cyc -- Tabu, Vtr -- Tabu, VVT in 2 classes are designed. Experiment takes with script in Python shows, that Vtr -- Tabu algorithm suits for small and median scale problem, especially for none-job-inseting high weighted date-related problem, while high stability and quality schedule in various aspects can be obtain with VVT algorithm.
